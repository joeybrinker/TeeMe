# TeeMe
TeeMe is a personal project of mine. TeeMe's purpose is to find close golf courses in the users area and show the available tee times for the day. (Unfortunately NBC has access to all of the tee time data and does not share with developers. Currently studying on how to make this a social media app for golf creators)

## Features
TeeMe shows you golf courses by using user location and also shows a route from the user to the golf course when the course is selected.
You can now create an account and favorite different golf courses around the world no matter where you look.
Users can create a user profile and submit their own scores to a feed where others can post and see.

## What I learned
So far I have learned a lot on how to use MapKit, user location principles, and database management. I continue to regularly work on this project so be on the lookout for updates and further development changes.

## How to use
- Click the "Code" button in the top right corner
- Download ZIP
- Extract ZIP
- Click on TeeMe.xcodeproj
- Once Xcode opens, run the project by clicking the play button which looks like an arrow in the top left
