# TeeMe
TeeMe is a personal project of mine. TeeMe's purpose is to find close golf courses in the users area and show the available tee times for the day.

## Features
Right now, TeeMe shows you golf courses by using user location and also shows a route from the user to the golf course when the course is selected.

## What I learned
So far I have learned a lot on how to use MapKit and user location principles. I continue to regularly work on this project so be on the lookout for updates and further development changes.
