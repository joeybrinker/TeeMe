# TeeMe
TeeMe is a personal project of mine. TeeMe's purpose is to find close golf courses in the users area and show the available tee times for the day.

## Features
TeeMe shows you golf courses by using user location and also shows a route from the user to the golf course when the course is selected.
You can now create an account which will soon let you favorite golf courses for ease of use

## What I learned
So far I have learned a lot on how to use MapKit and user location principles. I continue to regularly work on this project so be on the lookout for updates and further development changes.

## How to use
- Click the "Code" button in the top right corner

- Extract ZIP

- Once Xcode opens, run the project by clicking the play button which looks like an arrow in the top left
